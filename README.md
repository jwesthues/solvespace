SolveSpace
==========

This repository contains the source code of [SolveSpace][], a parametric
2d/3d CAD.

[solvespace]: http://solvespace.com

Installation
------------

### macOS (>=10.6 64-bit), Windows (>=Vista 32-bit)

Binary packages for macOS and Windows are available via
[GitHub releases][rel].

[rel]: https://github.com/solvespace/solvespace/releases

### Other systems

See below.

Building on Linux
-----------------

### Building for Linux

You will need CMake, zlib, libpng, cairo, freetype. To build the GUI, you will need
fontconfig, gtkmm 3.0 (version 3.16 or later), pangomm 1.4, OpenGL and OpenGL GLU, and
optionally, the Space Navigator client library.
On a Debian derivative (e.g. Ubuntu) these can be installed with:

    apt-get install cmake zlib1g-dev libpng-dev libcairo2-dev libfreetype6-dev
    apt-get install libjson-c-dev libfontconfig1-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev libpangomm-1.4-dev \
                    libgl-dev libglu-dev libspnav-dev

Before building, check out the necessary submodules:

    git submodule update --init extlib/libdxfrw

After that, build SolveSpace as following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make
    sudo make install

The graphical interface is built as `build/bin/solvespace`, and the command-line interface
is built as `build/bin/solvespace-cli`. It is possible to build only the command-line interface
by passing the `-DENABLE_GUI=OFF` flag to the cmake invocation.

### Building for Windows

You will need CMake and a Windows cross-compiler.
On a Debian derivative (e.g. Ubuntu) these can be installed with:

    apt-get install cmake mingw-w64

Before building, check out the necessary submodules:

    git submodule update --init

After that, build 32-bit SolveSpace as following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Toolchain-mingw32.cmake \
             -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make

Or, build 64-bit SolveSpace as following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Toolchain-mingw64.cmake \
             -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make

The graphical interface is built as `build/bin/solvespace.exe`, and the command-line interface
is built as `build/bin/solvespace-cli.exe`.

Space Navigator support will not be available.

Building on macOS
-----------------

You will need XCode tools, CMake, libpng and Freetype. To build tests, you
will need cairo. Assuming you use
[homebrew][], these can be installed with:

    brew install cmake libpng freetype cairo

XCode has to be installed via AppStore; it requires a free Apple ID.

Before building, check out the necessary submodules:

    git submodule update --init extlib/libdxfrw

After that, build SolveSpace as following:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make

The application is built in `build/bin/solvespace.app`, the graphical interface executable
is `build/bin/solvespace.app/Contents/MacOS/solvespace`, and the command-line interface executable
is `build/bin/solvespace.app/Contents/MacOS/solvespace-cli`.

[homebrew]: http://brew.sh/

Building on Windows
-------------------

You will need [git][gitwin], [cmake][cmakewin] and Visual C++.

### Building with Visual Studio IDE

Check out the git submodules. Create a directory `build` in
the source tree and point cmake-gui to the source tree and that directory.
Press "Configure" and "Generate", then open `build\solvespace.sln` with
Visual C++ and build it.

### Building with Visual Studio in a command prompt

First, ensure that git and cl (the Visual C++ compiler driver) are in your
`%PATH%`; the latter is usually done by invoking `vcvarsall.bat` from your
Visual Studio install. Then, run the following in cmd or PowerShell:

    git submodule update --init
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    nmake

### Building with MinGW

It is also possible to build SolveSpace using [MinGW][mingw], though
Space Navigator support will be disabled.

First, ensure that git and gcc are in your `$PATH`. Then, run the following
in bash:

    git submodule update --init
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    make
